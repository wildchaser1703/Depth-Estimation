# Project Setup

The library code in this repository has been taken from an open-source deep learning library called [TensorNet](https://github.com/shan18/TensorNet). The entire code of the library (corresponding to v0.9) has been included in the repository for ease of use.

To setup the project, just run:  
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
